** freebsd-info
A utility to retrieve information about current FreeBSD installation.

** Why?
Currently, we've got freebsd-version which gives some relevant information
but that's not enough for me and running sysctl for each entry... is just
not convenient. Shell scripts don't have long opts support, and using only
bare getopt can create possible collisions.

Now you know why. :)
